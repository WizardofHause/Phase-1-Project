Phase-1 Project

As a user, I want to be able to see my favorite albums and other information about them. I would like to see the track list, album name, artist name, as well as the date it was released and how popular it is. I would also like to be able to to add my favorite ones into a list so that I can refer back to them at a later time and update the popularity score as I see fit. It would also be nice to see an image of the album as well.
