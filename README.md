Phase-1 Project

:: As a user, I want to be able to take albums and ultimately rank/compare them by their popularity. Some core features of this include taking albums, returning their popularity score, allow users to build a "favorites bar," and then rank & compare them from most to least popular. 


EXECUTION:
Describe/sketch your ideas (use diagrams!).

Start by creating a frontend directory with the basic files you'll need

Next, build enough code to get some API data to work with. Don't worry about building all of your async code yet, just get to the point where you can access one endpoint on an API, then start working on getting that data displayed.

Then, continue to build additional async code and frontend features.

Continue building features one by one.


OBJECTIVES:
- Create a container for making "Favorites"
- Append tracks to the main display
- Automatically rank Favorites by popularity
- Make Popularity dynamic and adjustable
